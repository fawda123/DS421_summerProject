# Comparison of Weighted Regression and Generalized Additive Models

## UC Berkeley DS421 Summer Project



## Overview

This work is a portion of my summer project for the DS421 program and is joint work with Marcus Beck ([`fawda123`](https://github.com/fawda123/)).


## Directions
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/sastoudt/DS421_summerProject'
2. Cd into ~/DS421_summerProject/GAM_weightedReg_comparison/.
3. Install necessary software. You will need:


-  R, with the following packages installed:
	1. WRTDStidal
	2. dplyr
	3. mgcv
	4. ggplot2
	5. tidyr
	6. lubridate


## Run Shiny App

shiny::runGitHub("DS421_summerProject", "sastoudt", subdir = "GAM_weightedReg_comparison/shiny/")

This is created by using https://beckmw.shinyapps.io/sf_trends/ as a framework.
