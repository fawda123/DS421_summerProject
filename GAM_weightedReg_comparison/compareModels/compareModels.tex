Note: Skipping D4din, D4nh, D4no23, D6din, D6nh, D6no23, D7din, D7nh, D7no23 for now since most of the fitted values for WRTDS are missing.

\section{Observations}

\begin{itemize}
\item both methods have predictions (visually) very close to one another
\item RMSE for GAM less than that of WRTDS and same for deviance in all categories 
\item for the flow-normalized trends, the average for GAMs is often greater than or equal to (actually a lot of ties) that of WRTDS, the other way around for annual2, flows 2 and 3 sometimes 
\item percent change always opposite sign (C10din)? \textcolor{red}{must be an artifact?, looking back I calculated this wrong- will update}
\item  Note: for  AvgDiff negative percentages indicate WRTDS predictions were lower than GAM predictions
\item Mostly Neg: C10din, C10no23, P8din, P8no23
\item Mostly Pos: C10nh, C3din, C3nh, C3no23, P8nh, D19nh, D19no23, D26nh, D28nh
\item About 50/50: D19din, D26din, D26no23, D28din, D28no23
\item RMSE all pretty reasonable overall, breakdown reasonably uniform (don't want to read too much into this until full data is available in case missingness is driving anything)
\item Note: intercept > 0 WRTDS > GAM on average, slope < 1 GAM fits wider range
\item I don't want to read too much into slope significance until I fix the interpretation to significantly different than 1 instead of 0 (as it is now)
\item intercept significance should put the results from AvgDiff in perspective
\item Overall significant (so most): C10din, C10no23, C3din, C3nh, C3no23, P8din, P8nh, P8no23, D19din, D19nh, D19no23, D26din, D26nh, D26no23, D28din, D28nh, D28no23
\end{itemize}
